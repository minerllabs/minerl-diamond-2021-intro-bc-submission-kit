This repository contains the baseline solution for the intro track of NeurIPS MineRL 2021 competition,
placed inside the submission kit. This means it is ready for a submit with few changes!

# How to submit.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Update `aicrowd.json` file with your list of authors.
3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/minerllabs/competition_submission_template/#how-to-submit) to submit to AICrowd.

# Contents

This kit contains the ["BC plus script"](https://github.com/KarolisRam/MineRL2021-Intro-baselines/blob/main/standalone/BC_plus_script.py) baseline
solution, modified to fit into the submission baseline. See the original script on how to train the model, the code here only runs a pretrained agent.

Here is a list things that were modified over the [submission template](https://github.com/minerllabs/competition_submission_template/) to get things working.

1) Updated `aicrowd.json` to specify intro track with `"tags": "intro"`. Also set `"gpu": true` so that GPU used for running the model.
2) Updated `environment.yml` with the correct Python and PyTorch versions (note: it is important that you make sure these versions match your local setup, otherwise the agent may not work!).
3) Added the behavioural cloning model `another_potato.pth`  to `./train` directory
4) Updated `submission_test_code.py` by placing functions from the [baseline code](https://github.com/KarolisRam/MineRL2021-Intro-baselines/blob/main/standalone/BC_plus_script.py) into the file, and updating the main entry point inside `run_agent_on_episode` (at the end of the code file).
